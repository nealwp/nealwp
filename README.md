## About:

Passionate about system architecture, squashing complexity, and enhancing the effectiveness of dev teams.

I'd love to chat with you about challenges that you or your team may be facing. 

My approach to software engineering is to strike a balance between:

- Delivering value at a constant, sustainable pace
- Fostering a great developer environment 

I'm an accomplished software engineer and technologist with a database and analytics background. I'm well-versed in building systems in the cloud, and I'm highly proficient with Linux operating systems and relational databases. I have diverse industry experience including aerospace, logistics, defense, HR, finance, and renewable energy.
