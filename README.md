## About:

I'm passionate about writing code, but what really lights my fire is **building solutions**:fire:

I'd love to chat with you about the challenges that you or your team may be facing, 

My approach to software engineering is to strike a balance between:

- Delivering value to the customer at a constant, sustainable pace
- Fostering a great developer environment 


I'm an accomplished software engineer and technologist with a database and system administration background. I'm well-versed in building systems with cloud architecture. I'm highly proficient with Linux operating systems (RHEL/Ubuntu) and relational database management systems (RDBMS). 

I'm experienced in establishing and maintaining Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, as well as Git/GitHub/GitLab and source control. I have diverse industry experience including aerospace, logistics, defense, HR, and finance.
